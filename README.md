# voy

A CLI for following arxiv authors.

## Installation

Configure an environment with `python 3.12` and run the command:

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/floringogianu/voy.git
```

I used some experimental syntax that's only in `3.11` and above and I haven't aimed at backward compatibility yet.

## Usage

Just start with `voy --help`.
